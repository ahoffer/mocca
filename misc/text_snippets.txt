Quotable:

"Our observation is that PCA was only marginally better, if at all, than a random projection despite its computational intensity"
  -Clustering With EM and K-Means, Alldrin

Due to the lack of publicly available and sufciently complex clustering test suites, two new data generators have been developed for this purpose. The software for MOCK is available at http://dbk.ch.umist.ac.uk/handl/mock/.

"However, the drawback of random projection is that it is highly unstable - different random projections may lead to radically dierent clustering results. This instability led us to investigate a novel instantiation of the cluster ensemble framework (Strehl & Ghosh, 2002) based on random projections. In our framework, a single run of clustering consists of applying random projection to the high dimensional data and clustering the reduced data using EM. Multiple runs of clusterings are performed and the results are aggregated to form an n x n similarity matrix, where n is the number of instances. An agglomerative clustering algorithm is then applied to the matrix to produce the final clusters."

"...raw high-dimensional data can be expected to form very eccentric clusters, owing, for instance, to different units of measurement for different attributes."

 -Slightly correlated data will not have a significant advantage
 -Clusters almost aligned to the axis are almost as easy to detect as cluster exactly aligned to the axis.
 -Hypothesis: Higher dimensional ellipsoids are more globular than lower dimensional ellipsoids
     -Curse of dimensionality starts to affect the subspace as the number of dimensions in the subspace grows
 -Many non-globular clusters are unoriented clusters
 -Test for compactness of discovered clusters versus true clusters.
 -If the width is large enough, even elliptical clusters look globular. Draw a picture of an ellipse and a width comparable in length to the major axis. For comparison, draw a globular cluster. Show that the value of width that detects the globular cluster also detects the elliptical cluster.
 -Random projection and PCA are both considered dimensionality reduction techniques.
